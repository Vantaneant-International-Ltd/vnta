			<p class="subtitle">Working terms & legal framework</p>

			<p class="lede">
				These terms govern all engagements with VNTA (Vantanéant International Ltd).
				They are written in plain language and reflect how we actually work.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="section">
			<h2>1. About VNTA</h2>
			<p>
				VNTA is the trading name of <strong>Vantanéant International Ltd</strong>, an Irish
				company founded in 2025.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 2026, the business was rebranded from <em>Nadyr Entity Ltd</em> to
				<strong>Vantanéant International Ltd</strong>. All rights, obligations, and
				continuity remain unchanged.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="section">
			<h2>2. Services</h2>
			<p>
				VNTA provides brand leadership, strategic direction, and execution oversight.
				Services are delivered through fixed-term engagements, typically spanning
				multiple months.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are not an advisory-only consultancy. Where engaged, VNTA leads decision-making,
				sets direction, and coordinates execution directly.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="section">
			<h2>3. Engagements & Fees</h2>
			<p>
				All engagements are agreed in writing before commencement. Fees, scope, duration,
				and payment schedules are defined per engagement.
			</p>
			<p>
				Unless otherwise stated, fees are payable in advance and are non-refundable once
				work has commenced.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="section">
			<h2>4. Client Responsibilities</h2>
			<p>
				Clients agree to provide timely access to information, personnel, and materials
				required for the engagement.
			</p>
			<p>
				Delays caused by missing inputs or approvals may affect timelines without penalty
				to VNTA.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="section">
			<h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
			<p>
				Unless otherwise agreed, all final deliverables created specifically for the
				client become the client’s property upon full payment.
			</p>
			<p>
				VNTA retains the right to reference work in portfolios, case studies, and internal
				documentation unless explicitly restricted.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="section">
			<h2>6. Confidentiality</h2>
			<p>
				Both parties agree to keep confidential information private and not disclose it
				to third parties without prior consent.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="section">
			<h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
			<p>
				VNTA is not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from
				the use of its services.
			</p>
			<p>
				Any liability is limited to the fees paid for the specific engagement giving rise
				to the claim.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="section">
			<h2>8. Termination</h2>
			<p>
				Either party may terminate an engagement in accordance with the agreed contract
				terms.
			</p>
			<p>
				Fees for work completed up to the termination date remain payable.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="section">
			<h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
			<p>
				These terms are governed by the laws of Ireland. Any disputes fall under the
				exclusive jurisdiction of Irish courts.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="section">
